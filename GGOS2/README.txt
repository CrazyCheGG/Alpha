Here is an example of Batch Script "Operation System"
In the directory you will find:
> in the root you will find a **VERSIONS.txt** with the history of the project
> basicos.bat - basically small batch file with some stuff, i started but was too lazy to make better
> a few text files, from which the **path.txt** is the only file you need to configure with the path where
you store the operation system (example C:/GGOS2/OS)
> os.bat which is the main file
> test.html which was for test branch of the batch OS which ultimately failed (obv 2 years ago, i thought you can
make browser inside batch script)
> 1213G-GGOEM-INSTL-K9999-EFFFF is the dummy product key if you ever need it
If a program includes TM or Registered TM or anything like that, it was a pure joke for myself to show that the
thing might have a purpose. Anyways enjoy the samples. (everything that is published on the GitHub repository is
completely open source and protected by the GNU License, no trademarks in the programs are real)

The "OS" was made originally with installer but the idea broke and now it doesn't come with such one (you would
need to copy dummy 25-key product key as well as you would need 7-zip to "install" the "OS")

This is 2 year old project, so it might be not perfect. (also my old nickname can be seen here as well)
