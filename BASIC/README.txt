These are Basic *BASIC* programs which I did cuz I was bored in April (you can see my old nickname in the files).
Because I saved all of them in Binary instead of text, 
I will include 3 versions: 
> SRC_BIN 
> SRC_TXT
> BIN
There is also included INDEX.txt that is list with all programs and their status after testing

To launch some of them you may need MS DOS Virtual Machine with installed QBasic or DOSBOX Emulation with QBasic
NOTE: due to the nature of the Basic language, there may be varied results of the execution of some of the programs
(for example CARS.BAS and CARS11EM.BAS are version for MS DOS VM and DOSBOX Emulation)

~~imagine doing something that had purpose in the quarantine~~

If a program includes TM or Registered TM or anything like that, it was a pure joke for myself to show that the
thing might have a purpose. Anyways enjoy the samples. (everything that is published on the GitHub repository is
completely open source and protected by the GNU License, no trademarks in the programs are real)

QBasic is an old Microsoft Software for the Basic programming language.

Any of the BASIC binaries included are 16-Bit programs, they may have troubles running on 64-Bit hardware and may
need emulator (like DOSBOX)
